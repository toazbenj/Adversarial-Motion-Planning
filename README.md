# Adversarial-Motion-Planning
Discrete time dynamic game control system library with tools for building decision making strategies using cost-to-go and linear optimization. See Drag Race for simulation model of racing scenarios for autonomous vehicles. See navigation lab for ROS 1 implementation of leader/follower and lane merging games for turtlebot hardware using linear quadratic regulators and stopping states.
